          Journalism is a great career choice for inquisitive people who like telling stories and aren’t afraid of hard
          work. A career in journalism is demanding, fast-paced and exciting. It enables you to travel, meet new people
          and explore interesting affairs.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Journalism is still a highly important and respected profession. The task of communicating truths and
            informing people of news topics will always play a vital role in society.
          </li>
          <li>
            As American reporter and political commentator Walter Lippmann brilliantly stated, ‘There can be no higher
            law in journalism than to tell the truth and to shame the devil.’
          </li>
          <h3>Journalism at a Glance</h3>
          <li>
            Journalists may be reporting in the field in faraway lands, operating solely online or working from
            broadcasting studios.

            In a nutshell, journalists tell stories. They produce news reports on anything, from politics and sports to
            Hollywood gossip and science.
          </li>
          <h3>How to Become a Journalist?</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.5;font-size:15px;">
            Here, we detail the step-by-step process to becoming a journalist. This guide is applicable to those
            pursuing journalism careers in multiple countries including the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia and New
            Zealand
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3> Obtain a Bachelor’s Degree</h3>
            There is no written rule that states journalists must have a bachelor’s degree to enter the industry. In
            fact, you’re sure to come across many journalists who aren’t educated to degree level
          </li>
        </ol>

        <img src="/image/img4.png" alt="trident" style="height:450px;" />

      </div>
      <div class="sec abt3">




        <img src="/image/img1.png" alt="trident" style="height:450px; position:relative;top:30px;" />

      </div>

      <div class="sec abt4">
        <ul>
          <h3>However, most journalists have obtained a bachelor’s degree.</h3>
          <Li>
            Many employers prefer journalists to have a degree in a content-specific subject - for example, politics or
            science - rather than journalism itself. This enables journalists to specialise and utilise their subject
            knowledge to serve as an expert in their field.
          </Li>
          <li>
            Of course, a degree in journalism directly isn’t frowned upon by any means. It’s still a highly relevant
            degree that provides future journalists with a platform to excel in journalism. But when considering which
            degree to study, consider which area of journalism you would like to specialise in. It might be beneficial
            to obtain a degree in that sphere, rather than journalism itself.

            Let’s take a look at the degrees of some of the most well-known journalists of today.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3> Study a Post-Graduate Degree</h3>
            For those who want to advance their careers in journalism or approach their first job with a stronger
            academic background, it’s a good idea to obtain a master’s degree from journalism school.
          </li>
          <Li>
            Many journalists claim that post-graduate courses gave them skills, knowledge and experiences that were
            vital in their career progression. Others claim post-grad study is not necessary.

          </Li>
          <li>

            <h3>Gain Hands-on Journalism Experience While You Study</h3>
            While education is a vital aspect of journalists’ development, there is no replacement for hands-on
            experience. On-the-job experience is what enables journalists to put their knowledge into practice and
            improve their capabilities alongside seasoned experts.
